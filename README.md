This project is beeing developted by two developers from ESMAD and the principal objective is to create an application where it relies helping on the consultation, subscription, management of the school events 

The repository is divided in two folders, the "AtlantisPROJECT",where the source code is located and the "modulos" is where our first mockups are located

To run "Atlantis" you have to have vue installed in your machine, then, after you downloaded the files, you have to install the components in your folder where the source code is located. We use Vue Router and VueX, so, you have to have installed this extensions in your machine, in order to run "Atlantis".

In the name of "Atlantis" and and from the developers, we would like to thank our teachers for giving us the tools necessary for creating this project, and everyone who support us on this journey,
